# OpenFinance: A New Path Forward

## Our Vision

We believe finance should be honest, transparent, and accessible to all. The current system isn't working for most people - it's complicated, expensive, and often puts profits over people.

## What We're Building

**Bubble Invest** is our first step toward a better financial future. We're creating:

1. **A Smarter Investment Platform** - An intelligent, low-cost robo-advisor that puts your interests first
2. **Business Automation Tools** - Helping small and medium businesses in France embrace modern technology and workflows

## Our Commitments

- **Radical Transparency** - No hidden fees, no surprise costs
- **Ethical Investing** - Supporting long-term value over short-term gains
- **Fair Compensation** - We've capped wealth accumulation at â‚¬5 million per person in our company
- **Empowerment Through Education** - Providing the knowledge you need to make informed decisions
- **Technological Innovation** - Using AI and automation to reduce costs and improve outcomes

## Why We're Different

Most investment platforms are built to extract maximum value from their customers. We're building the investment platform we want to use ourselves - one where success is shared.

Think of traditional finance as a family building a Lego castle, where one member hoards 90% of the blocks. We're redistributing those blocks to build something magnificent together.
