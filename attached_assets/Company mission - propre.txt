10. Innovative Wealth Distribution Model

At OpenFinance, we believe that the concentration of wealth at the top is not just unfair, but actively harmful to economic growth and societal well-being. We liken traditional finance to a family building a Lego castle, where one member hoards 90% of the blocks, impeding the family's ability to create something truly magnificent together.

Our revolutionary wealth distribution model is designed to break this cycle and embody our commitment to fairness, shared success, and economic empowerment:

a) Wealth Cap: 
   - Founders, shareholders, and employees are limited to accumulating a maximum of €5 million in wealth within the company.
   - This cap applies to all forms of compensation including salary, bonuses, and equity.

b) Collective Wealth Fund:
   - All value generated above the €5 million per person cap is channeled into a Collective Wealth Fund.
   - This fund benefits all employees based on tenure and contribution, ensuring that company success translates to shared prosperity.

c) Competitive Compensation:
   - We offer competitive base salaries to attract and retain top talent.
   - Performance bonuses and equity grants are provided to all employees, subject to the overall wealth cap.

d) Profit Sharing:
   - A significant portion of company profits is distributed among all employees annually.

e) Long-Term Value Creation:
   - We implement long-term incentive plans using phantom stocks and performance units, aligning everyone's interests with the company's sustained success.

f) Transparent and Equitable Structure:
   - Clear, published pay bands for all positions.
   - Regular pay equity audits to ensure fairness.
   - Maximum ratio between highest and lowest paid employee (e.g., 10:1).

g) Collective Decision Making:
   - Employee representation on compensation committees.
   - Company-wide votes on significant compensation matters.

h) Community and Economic Impact:
   - In liquidity events, a portion of proceeds is dedicated to a foundation for financial literacy and inclusion.
   - We commit to reinvesting a significant portion of our profits into economic development initiatives.

This model ensures that as OpenFinance grows, the benefits are shared widely - among our team, our customers, and society at large. By rejecting the winner-takes-all mentality of traditional finance, we're not just building a company, but fostering an ecosystem where shared success drives innovation, satisfaction, and sustainable growth.

We believe this approach will not only make us a more attractive employer and a more ethical company, but will also drive our mission of democratizing finance and creating lasting positive change in the financial industry and beyond.

By staying true to our mission and continuously innovating, we aim to build a company that not only disrupts the current financial paradigm but also creates lasting positive change in the world of investing and beyond.
